# PolyRep 
This project focuses on the representation and manipulation of polynomials using arrays of coefficients.
Each element in the array corresponds to a coefficient, and its index represents the power of x. 
The goal is to create a set of functions that allow operations on polynomials such as evaluation, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and differentiation.
This approach provides an efficient and flexible way to represent polynomial equations and perform various mathematical operations programmatically.
